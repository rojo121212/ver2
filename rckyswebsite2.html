        <h2>soooo you clicked the link..</h2>
            <p> hi :) 
                <br></br>
                if i remember correctly, we started dating a month ago today. 
                since i can't be with you in person and a letter wouldn't 
                get to you in time, i made you a website with words soo
                get ready to read 
                <br></br>
                these past couple months have been full of you. 
                whether we're calling, texting, hanging out, or whatever it may be,
                you're the only person i want to talk to. you make all my days better and with 
                just your presence you somehow manage to make every worry i hold disappear.
                you remind me of every love song i hear and talking to you makes me 
                feel like i'm living out every laufey tune i love.
                <br></br>
                nothing compares to how i feel about you. you do unspeakable things
                to my heart every day that i'm away from you and you've invaded my brain
                because i can't seem to think about anything else. all i ever want is to do 
                something that involves you. playing overcooked, making tea and cookies, going
                on night drives, getting ramen, movies in pjs.
                <br></br>
                you're easily the best person i know and i think we were made for 
                each other. you have the softest heart and (sometimes) the funniest jokes. 
                you know how to make people smile and you make everyone in your life feel
                 special. you're unbelieveably talented in every way, from your artwork to 
                 the way you do life. you're insanely beautiful and you hold a level of intelligence
                 that albert einstein only wishes he could posess. 
                you are truly one of a kind and you've taken full hold of my heart. 
                i'm so lucky i get to be your girlfriend. 
                <br></br>
                happy one month olivia ritter <33
